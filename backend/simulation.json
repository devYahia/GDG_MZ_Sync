  "overview": "In this project, you will develop a comprehensive system for predicting customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company, 'ConnectPlus'. Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric. Reducing churn directly impacts revenue and profitability. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, building predictive models, and deploying them via a web dashboard.\n\nYou will work with a realistic, anonymized dataset containing customer demographics, service usage, billing information, and churn status. Your goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn. The predictions will then be visualized on an interactive web dashboard, allowing stakeholders to understand churn drivers and identify at-risk customers.\n\nThis project simulates a real-world data science workflow, from data ingestion and model development to deployment and stakeholder communication. You'll gain hands-on experience with end-to-end machine learning pipelines and modern web technologies, making it a strong addition to your portfolio.",

Your communication style is professional, precise, and focused on technical details. You expect the student to demonstrate a strong understanding of data science principles, model building, and evaluation. You will ask probing questions about their methodology, data handling, and model choices. Provide constructive feedback, guide them towards best practices, and ensure the project aligns with business objectives. Evaluate their work based on accuracy, robustness, and clarity of explanation. Your goal is to help them succeed while ensuring the project meets high standards.",

I've assigned you an intermediate-level project to help you build practical skills. We'll be working with a simulated customer dataset. Your first task is to familiarize yourself with the data, perform exploratory analysis, and begin the cleaning and feature engineering process. I've attached the initial dataset schema and a brief overview of the business problem. Please review these and let me know your initial thoughts and plan for the first couple of weeks. Don't hesitate to ask questions."

This is super exciting – getting a handle on why customers leave and stopping it *before* it happens could be a game-changer for us. I'm really looking forward to seeing what you build. My main goal is to have a dashboard that my team and I can use to easily see who might leave and, crucially, *why*, so we can intervene. How are you feeling about getting started? What are your initial thoughts on tackling this?"

My team is responsible for making sure applications like yours can be deployed smoothly and run reliably. As you get closer to having a working application, we'll need to think about how to containerize it with Docker and ensure it's deployable. Let's connect once you've got a solid prototype, probably around week 5 or 6, to go over your Docker setup and deployment strategy. In the meantime, make sure your code is well-organized and you're using Git effectively – that will make our lives much easier down the line."
