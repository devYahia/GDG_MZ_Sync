# Project Walkthrough - GDG

## Phase 1: Setup & Initialization
- **Step 1: Spec Kit Initialization**
  - Initialized `spec-kit` in the existing project directory using `specify init . --ai agy --force`.
  - Verified installation with `specify check`.
  - Result: `.specify` directory created with memory, scripts, and templates. Antigravity (agy) is set as the active agent.
- **Step 2: Project Constitution**
  - Created `CONSTITUTION.md` based on the `@spec-kit` template and project specific requirements from `user_global` memory.
  - Defined core principles including Demo-Driven MVP, Tech Stack Alignment, and Security First.
